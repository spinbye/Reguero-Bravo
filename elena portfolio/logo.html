            Reguero Bravo arises from finding the union of these </br>
            two apparently contrary words. A reguero is something </br>
            that is dropped, that comes out on its own. But a trail </br>
            can also be created by a brave horse when it gallops </br>
            strongly on the grass. I wanted to show as a flow with </br>
            a certain ferocity a selection of works that I have done </br>
            until now. </br></br>
            I asked my father to draw with his black Pilot the letters </br>
            that led you to this page, because he has the first surname </br>
            and good handwriting. I have modified them later with a </br>
            brush that I created in Illustrator because I liked that </br>
            they interpreted pixels as a glitch. </br>
